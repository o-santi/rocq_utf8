  abstract="AUTOMATH is a language intended for expressing detailed mathematical thoughts. It is not a programming language, although it has several features in common with existing programming languages. It is defined by a grammar, and every text written according to its rules is claimed to correspond to correct mathematics. It can be used to express a large part (see 1.6) of mathematics, and admits many ways for laying the foundations. The rules are such that a computer can be instructed to check whether texts written in the language are correct. These texts are not restricted to proofs of single theorems; they can contain entire mathematical theories, including the rules of inference used in such theories.",

of semantic preservation) of a compiler from Cminor (a C-like
imperative language) to PowerPC assembly code, using the Coq proof
assistant both for programming the compiler and for proving its
correctness.  Such a certified compiler is useful in the context of
formal methods applied to the certification of critical software: the
certification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as well.},
